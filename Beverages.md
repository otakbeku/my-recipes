## Dates with Goat :goat: :tea:

### Ingredients

1. Goat milk. I prefer the powder instead of liquid
2. Seedless dates or you can put away the seed from dates (3 or 5)
3. *Kurma Madu* or you can any mix of honey and dates juice

### Steps

1. Prepare the goat milk first. Don't pour the *kurma madu* yet. Let it little bit cooler but still warm.
2. Prepare the seedless dates. Removes the seed from the dates. I prefer to slice on one side so the milk can go through the dates.
3. Pour the *kurma madu* into the milk. I usually take 3 teaspoons because kurma madu is too sweet and the powdered goat milk is already sweet too. Stir well then add the seedless dates. Stir again so the milk is infused into the dates
4. Enjoy! Best serve when the milk is warm.

### Additional Notes

1. You can create your own kurma madu by combining the dates juice with honey but I'm not the ratio to create it. I'll do the research first
2. Don't eat a whole date in one bite. Eat it half, put it into milk, and eat the rest. Trust me, you might enjoy this. It tastes better.
3. **THIS IS THE BEST SAHOOR MEAL IN RAMADAN**. The dates and *kurma madu* give us energy for the whole day and hot milk warms our fajr.

## Black Fiber :tea:	

### Ingredients

1. Black tea. I don't use Earl Grey or Darjeeling because Earl Grey is best matched with cow milk and Darjeeling is the only black tea that doesn't need any mixture to serve (The perfect one and the legend)
2. Fiber creme .... Yeah I know, this one would be a little bit different from the first recipe.
3. *Kurma madu*. Since I get cold, this ingredient is the best one when serving hot/warm beverages.

### Steps

1. Serve your black tea like usual with boiled water for 3 minutes. I use a tea bag with 250~300 ml water. Removes the tea bag before adding fiber creme
2. Add fiber creme. Please mind your dose of creamer. Since we use it on black tea, just add 3 to 4 teaspoons. Don't add too much or you will only taste the creamer.
3. Last add *kurma madu*. Don't add it too much, you don't want to ruin your so-called alternate milk tea, right?
4. Serve best when still hot or warmer

### Additional Notes

1. Not my best beverage but I still enjoyed it. If you don't like the fiber creme, you can add any unsweetened condensed milk with the ratio of 1:3 with the black tea. Then add a little *kurma madu*.
2. Since this is an alternative to milk tea, drink this in the afternoon or evening. I don't know why, but this doesn't match with morning or noon.
3. This beverage is not a sweet drink, otherwise, I tried to create a similar drink like traditional milk tea but I don't want to disappear the taste of the black tea. I used *kurma madu* because the dates juice creates a fruity flavor with the black tea. Fiber creme is used to bring up the milk tea's taste.

### G-OAT Drink :goat: :tea:

### Ingredients

1. Goat milk. I prefer the powder ones
2. Instant Oat or any oat that ready to serve with warm water or milk
3. Optional: berries, dates, or honey

### Steps

1. Prepare the goat milk first
2. Add oats but not too much. The purpose is to make it a drink, not a meal.
3. Done!
4. Additional, it is not like other oats meals for breakfast, you can't add any berries instead add dates (seedless) or honey
5. Serve when still warm

### Additional Notes

1. The name is a pun (I know this is lame). Goat milk is a little bit different from cow milk where you can't create cereal with it, so make sure you don't add too many oats.
2. I drink this in the morning before I went to class. Goat milk and oats give me whole day energy. Sometimes I drink this by eating 3 dates (without putting in your drink).
