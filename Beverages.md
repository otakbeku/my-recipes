## Dates with Goat :goat: :tea:

### Ingredients

1. Goat milk. I prefer with the powder instead in liquid
2. Seedless dates or you can put away the seed from dates (3 or 5)
3. *Kurma Madu* or you can any mix of honey and dates juice

### Steps

1. Prepare the goat milk first. Don't pour the *kurma madu* yet. Let it little bit cooler but still warmer.
2. Prepare the seedless dates. removes the seed from the dates. I prefer to slice the one side so the milk can go through the dates.
3. Pour the *kurma madu* to the milk. I usually take 3 teaspoon because kurma madu is too sweet and the goat milk in powder already sweet too. Stir well then add the seedless dates. Stir again so the milk infused to the dates
4. Enjoy! Best serve in warmer milk.

### Additional Notes

1. You can create your own kurma madu by combine the dates juice with honey but I'm not the ratio to create it. I'll do the research first
2. Don't eat a whole dates in one bite. Eat it half, put in to milk and eat the rest. Trust me, you might enjoy this.
3. **THIS IS THE BEST SAHOOR MEAL IN RAMADAN**. The dates and *kurma madu* give us energy for the whole day and hot milk warms our fajr.

## Black Fiber :tea:	

### Ingredients

1. Black tea. I don't use Earl Grey or Darjeeling because Earl Grey best matched with milk and Darjeeling is the only black tea that doesn't need any mixture to serve (The perfect one, hehehe)
2. Fiber creme .... Yeah I know, this one would be little bit different with the first recipe.
3. *Kurma madu*. Since I get cold, this ingredient is the best one when serving hot/warm beverages.

### Steps

1. Serve your black tea like usual with boiling water for 3 minutes. I use tea bag with 250~300 ml water. Removes the tea bag before adding fiber creme
2. Add fiber creme. Please mind your dose of creamer. Since we use it on black tea, just add 3 to 4 teaspoon. More that that you will only taste the creamer.
3. Last add *kurma madu*. Don't add it too much, you don't want to ruin your so-called alternate milk tea, right?
4. Serve best when still hot or warmer

### Additional Notes

1. Not my best beverage but I still enjoyed it. If you don't like the fiber creme, you can add any nonsweetened condensed milk with the ratio 1:1 with the black tea. Then add a little *kurma madu*.
2. Since this is an alternative of mlik tea, drink this in the afternoon or evening. I don't know why, but this doens't matched with morning or noon.
3. This beverage is not sweet drink, otherwise I tried to create a similiar drink like traditional milk tea but I don't want to disappeared the taste of the black tea. I used *kurma madu* because the dates juce create a fruitty flavour with the black tea. Fiber creme used to bring up the milktea's taste.

### G-OAT Drink :goat: :tea:

### Ingredients

1. Goat milk. I prefer the powder ones
2. Instant Oat or any oat that ready to server with warm water or milk
3. Optional: berries, dates or honey

### Steps
1. Prepare the goat milk first
2. Add oats but not to much. The purpose is making it as drink, not a meal.
3. Done!
4. Additional, it not like other oats meal for breakfast, you can't add any berries instead add dates (seedless) or honey
5. Serve when still warm

### Additional Notes

1. The name is a pun (I know this is lame). Goat milk is little bit different with cow milk where you can't a cereal with it, so make sure you don't too much oats. 
2. I drink this in the morning before I went to class. Goat milk and oatsgives me a whole day energy. Sometimes I drink this with eating 3 dates (without put in your drink).
