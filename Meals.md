## Iron Sandwich :bread: :egg:

### Ingredients

1. Sliced Bread
2. Any mix you want for your sandwich

### Tools

1. Iron (I named it iron sandwich with a purpose)

### Steps

1. Combine your mixture to create the sandwich and then cook it with iron.
2. Done!

### Additional Notes

1. This was originally my experience when living in the place that doesn't have any proper kitchen so I use my iron to cook it. My favorites is 'grilled-cheese'-like sandwich.
2. Please cover your precious sandwich with aluminium foil first before put it on an iron. Don't forget to turn back so it cooked well
3. If you are broke enough and don't have any kitchen, iron is the best alternative to cook anything (anything that grilled I guess).

## Beaten Bread :bread: :egg:

### Ingredients

1. Eggs (1 or 2)
2. Sliced bread (2-3 pieces)
3. Salt and pepper

### Steps

1. Beaten the eggs and add salts and peppers
2. Bath the bread to egg and cook it (**DO NOT USE IRON LIKE THE FIRST RECIPE TO COOK THIS. USE PROPER COOKING TOOLS**). Don't forget to turn back the other side. Don't undercooked it (it tastes worst if undercooked).

### Additional Notes

1. Sometimes I slices the bread (after cooked) into 3x3

## Fried-noodle Sandwich :bread: :egg:

### Ingredients

1. Fried Noodles (**I prefer to use Indomie's fried noodles because the taste is beyond other noodles!**)
2. Sliced bread
3. An egg
4. Additionals: vegetables and seasoning

### Steps

1. Serve the noodle first. Follow the instructions and make sure it's cooked well.
2. Heat the pan and put the breads first. Till is get little bit brown, cook the egg. I prefer with the sunny side up (you can half-cooked it).
3. Put a half of the noodle to the upside bread. Add the egg and the rest of the noodle and then the other bread. Don't overcooked it. Just do it like other sandwich. Caution the noodle is already well served and if you overcooked it, the noodle will dried up.
4. Put it on the plate, slice the sandwich diagonally and serve.

### Additional notes

1. This is the best sandwich ever. The flavour of the fried noodles with juicy seasoning on it goes through the bread to your mouth with half-cooked egg that enrich the taste. Brilliants!
2. **DON'T ADD ANY CHEESE ON IT! IT'S NOT SAMYANG**
3. Just 1 portion is enough for me
