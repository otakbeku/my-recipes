# My Recipes!

My own recipes for my coding activity including meal and beverage. Feel free to try your own. These recipes are made based on my taste of food, might be weird for you.

Yeah, I put a silly name on my recipes because I'm bad at naming anything rationally except variables on my programming stuffs.

If I have any typo or wrong grammar or anything, feel free to inform me. Thank you and enjoy your meal!
