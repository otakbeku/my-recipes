# My Recipes!

My own recipes for my coding activity include meals and beverages. Feel free to try your own. These recipes are made based on my taste of food, which might be weird for you.

Yeah, I put a silly name on my recipes because I'm bad at naming anything rationally except variables on my programming stuff (Imma rite?).

If I have any typo or wrong grammar or anything, feel free to inform me. Thank you and enjoy your meal!
